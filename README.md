Startup data collected from crunchbase having containing information like investments, aquisitions, funding amounts,
social profiles of members etc.

## Problem Statements identified:

* Understanding the social behavior of founders and look out for relationships between the significant events (for e.g a major funding round closed) and the fluctuations in social behavior.

* Derive the personality traits and the skill-sets of the founders and figure out if these characteristics have a significant influence on the success of their ventures.
